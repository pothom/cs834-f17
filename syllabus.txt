This class will explore the theory and engineering of information
retrieval in the context of developing web-based search engines. We
will explore issues related to crawling, ranking, query processing,
retrieval models, evaluation, clustering, machine learning, and other
aspects related to building web search engines. The class will feature a
mix of hands-on development and coding, as well as theoretical exploration
of the existing literature on these topics. Students must be comfortable
with self-directed learning appropriate for an advanced graduate class.

Prerequisites: Advanced graduate standing.

Attendance Policy: Attendance is required for class participation,
presentation, and discussion.  Absences must cleared with the instructor
prior to class.  You are responsible for everything that is said, 
discussed, and presented during class.


Grading: 

   The class grade will consist of:
	* 5 research paper presentations worth 10 points each (50 total)
	  (presentations will be made in class)
	* 5 homework sets worth 10 points each (50 total)

   The grading scale will be:	

	A  = 100-94
